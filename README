Welcome to Biblioteca!

When entering the application, users will be able to go to either a movie section or a book section.

Once done selecting the section, users will be able to:
- View list of books/movies
- Check Out a book/movie (One at a time)
- Return a book/movie (One at a time)
- Re-route to the other section
- Exit the application

If users choose to check out or return books/movies, the system will require their login information, including userIDs
in the format of "XXX-XXXX" and passwords.

When users successfully log into the system, a welcome message with the user's email address and phone number will be displayed.
Then the users can select a specific book/movie to return to Biblioteca.

Once successfully checking out or returning the book/movie, the users will be able to choose the next action they
want to take from the list displayed above.

The system will not end until the users give the command of EXITING.
